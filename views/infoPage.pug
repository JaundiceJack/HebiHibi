    //This page will include basic reptile info such as current and past weights,
    //shedding schedules, bathing, and other non-food or cage related data.
    
    // Weight & Size & Age
      Every type of reptile will have their weights tracked.
      Recommended readings will be monthly.
      I'd like an expandable graph to show plotted weight over time.
      This section will also allow users to input the birthday/year of their
      reptile which will be used to display their current age.
      For size, it will primaryly be length from snout to tail tip.
      Girth may aslo be recorded, which will be important for determining
      whether the reptile is over or underweight.

    // Handling and Mood
      Most reptiles require time to destress between handlings
      In this section I'd like to be able to inform and track how the Specific
      reptile should be handled. Like the last day it was out. Maybe a Color
      to pick their reaction to being handled. maybe I dont need this section

    // Vet Info
      Here I could track vet information such as past illnesses and vet visits.
      The address/phone/email of your preferred vet and maybe a general one for each
      state.
