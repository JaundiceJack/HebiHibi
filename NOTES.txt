11: I found a similar program (for pay) called ReptiWare. It does a bit of what I'm making (but looks cooler).
	I did not see that it had graphs of information, but it did show tables of info,
	I could make the charts and tables swappable with a button
	They also didn't seem to use any sensor integration, so I'd have that over it as well.
	Wow, They charge $7 per month or $70 per year. Its not a flat charge. I could charge for usage as well, but cheaper.

For the cageGraphs branch, I'd like to flesh out the skeleton I left off at.
Currently one can enter the date, heat, cool, and humid, and a point will appear on the graph.
The point can be from any date though, and the data is not organized chronologically.
I would like to make the graphs swappable between days and weeks.
I would like to have 24 data points for each day. One per hour.
graphs default to week-view and take the average temperature for the days.
clicking on a specific day takes the user to the graphed points for that day.
So I'll need to make a mock-up of what the graphs should look like/the data they should handle.
Then I'll need to look at the database model and modify it to take day-based data.
And any additional data required. It may be a good idea to separate the temperature and humidity entries.
A dropdown for the hour of the day in addition to the date.

The reading model is connected to the reptiles by the reptile_id, so I can modify it without worrying about fucking up the reptile model. Keep things separated where possible

I'll need to figure out how to add buttons to the graph itself, as well as linking their functionality.
Easiest way would be to have them appear upon page-load, hidden until usable.

I should relearn
