1. Adding bootstrap messed with my styles. Once the user system is working, go back through and convert what you can to bootstrap.
2. You've made a route to the user profile page. Create a user profile page to display.
3. Add media queries to the CSS for tablet and phone resolutions.
4. Add age display to the growth section.
5. Add a reproduction page (involving punnet squares to track genetics).
6. Bootstrap alert styles seem to interfere with custom formats, fixit?
7: Change the header grid to a flex (would make a little more sense)
8: My flash messages don't seem to disappear, fixit.
9: Label margins are acting wierd, ...fixit
10: Right now I'm sending all reptile data at once. This could get cumbersome later.
	To fix it I'd like to turn the reptiselects into links and use variable get paths based on the reptiID
