1. Adding bootstrap messed with my styles. Once the user system is working, go back through and convert what you can to bootstrap.
2. You've made a route to the user profile page. Create a user profile page to display.
3. Add media queries to the CSS for tablet and phone resolutions.
4. Add age display to the growth section.
5. Add a reproduction page (involving punnet squares to track genetics).
6. Bootstrap alert styles seem to interfere with custom formats, fixit?
7: Change the header grid to a flex (would make a little more sense)
8: My flash messages don't seem to disappear, fixit.
9: Label margins are acting wierd, ...fixit
