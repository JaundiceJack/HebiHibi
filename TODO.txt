1. Adding bootstrap messed with my styles. Once the user system is working, go back through and convert what you can to bootstrap.
2. You've made a route to the user profile page. Create a user profile page to display.
3. Add media queries to the CSS for tablet and phone resolutions.
4. Add age display to the growth section.
5. Add a reproduction page (involving punnet squares to track genetics).
6. Bootstrap alert styles seem to interfere with custom formats, fixit?
7: Change the header grid to a flex (would make a little more sense)
8: My flash messages don't seem to disappear, fixit.
9: Label margins are acting wierd, ...fixit
10: Having the reptile ID as the URL string looks a bit ugly, I'd like to replace it with the name
	This would probably involve querying by name instead of ID and setting global ID then.

11: I found a similar program (for pay) called ReptiWare. It does a bit of what I'm making (but looks cooler).
	I did not see that it had graphs of information, but it did show tables of info,
	I could make the charts and tables swappable with a button
	They also didn't seem to use any sensor integration, so I'd have that over it as well.
	Wow, They charge $7 per month or $70 per year. Its not a flat charge. I could charge for usage as well, but cheaper.

12: Ideally when enclosure data is entered, I'd like to check that the date is not already in the reptile's files
	If the date is found I'd like to update the cool/warm/humid with the newly entered data
